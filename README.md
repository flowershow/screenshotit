Screenshots as URLs.

Want a screenshot of a page for any reason? Just drop a link. Get a clean, browser-faithful screenshot. Instantly embeddable. Cached forever.

One-sentence value proposition
This is the simplest way to clip the web: turn any page into a stable image just using the URL.

Most screenshot tools are dashboards, APIs, or workflows you have to integrate. This is different. Here, the screenshot *is the URL*.

You paste a link like:

`screenshot.app/https://example.com`

and you get a real-browser screenshot you can embed anywhere—Markdown, blogs, wikis, notes, docs, or posts—without setup, SDKs, or UI.

It’s designed for writers, researchers, publishers, and builders who want web clippings that just work: no copy-paste, no manual uploads, no broken embeds when pages change.

What makes it different
• URL-native: screenshots are addressable resources, not files you manage
• Embed-first: made for Markdown, static sites, wikis, and notes
• Stable by default: cached, immutable, and safe to reference long-term
• Opinionated defaults: clean, above-the-fold captures without tweaking
• Zero workflow: paste once, done forever

What it’s for
• Clipping references into essays, research notes, or white papers
• Capturing homepage or hero states for documentation
• Creating visual previews in Markdown-based sites
• Preserving how a page looked *at the moment you cited it*

What it’s not
It’s not a screenshot editor, a dashboard, or a testing suite.
It’s a primitive: **the web → image, via URL**.
